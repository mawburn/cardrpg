# Human Definition

Species will be defined by the [[Mechanics/Species Rules|Species Rules]] to make balance easier, since the intent is to have a lot of different playable Species.

## Description

Humans are seen as untrustworthy and swindlers by many other species. One Gnoll Prince who asked to remain unamed said this about them:

> They are conniving hairless apes that would sell their own pups for a couple cards.

Which should say a lot coming from a Gnoll of all beings.

## History

Like many other species, The Drop was thrust upon the Humans in a flash.
