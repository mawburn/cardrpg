# Rules for laying out cards

* **Be relevant to the species**
	* Such as how they act, think, and other details about them that makes them unique.
* **Decide up front on what percentage should be of which [[Mechanics/Cards/Species Cards#Card Types|Card Type]]**
- **Should take into account any other specials the species has**

## Card Types

| Name     | Info                                                                                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Passive  | Always active, except during the Swapping action                                                                  |
| Modifier | Should modify something else, but not give an effect directly                                  |
| Move     | Usually has a cooldown <br /> Usually has requirements                                  |
| Spell    | Almost always has a cooldown & damage higher than a Move <br /> Almost always has requirements | 

## Card Rarity

| Rarity    | Copies                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| Common    | 5 Copies of the card per 100 |
| Uncommon  | 3 Copies of the card per 100 |
| Rare      | 2 Copies of the card per 100 |
| Very Rare | 1 Copy of the card per 100   |
| Legendary | 1 Legendary card per 100     |

This means, a move that is Common has a 5% chance of being drawn and there can be many different common cards throughout a Species Deck. The same for the others, except for Legendary. A Species Deck will only contain 1 Legendary card.
