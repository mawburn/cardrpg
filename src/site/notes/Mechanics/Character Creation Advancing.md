# Creation

When creating a new character, the player starts at level 1.

They roll a 1d4 for each Stat to determine what their Attributes will be to begin.

The player then rolls 3d6 to determine their starting HP.

The player then rolls 1d100/percentile die to determine which species card they start with.

The player then assigns a skills using die sizes.

- 1 skill can be a D4
- 1 skill can be a D6
- 1 skill can be a D8
- 1 skill can be a D10
- 1 skill can be a D12

These skills represent who you were before you became a card wielding hero and are not affected by your Attributes at all, as they are for the RP aspect of the game. They may however, be affected by your equipped cards.

Think about these carefully. Your higher dice should align closely with the background of your character. As you level up you may be able to change these around, to reflect the growth you have obtained from being an adventurer.

## Advancement

When a character archives a new level, they may do several things.

1. Reroll up to 2 Attributes and add the player's level, if rolled lower keep the original value. When the player reaches level 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20. They may begin to use those die sizes instead of the D4.
   1. If a player reaches level 5, this means they can roll a D4 on any 2 Attributes they wish. But when the player is at reaches levels 6 and 7 they may roll a D6 on any 2 Attributes they wish.
   2. Technically optional, but unless the player is very lucky and maxed out on all their attributes, this is suggested.
2. Roll 1d6 and add that plus their level to their HP.
   1. If a player has 15 HP and advances to level 3 and they rolled a 2 on their D6, they add 2 from the dice and 3 from their level resulting in 20 HP.
3. If the player is below or equal to level 10, they may roll on their Species' card table again, adding the new card to their deck.
   1. This does **not** replace previously rolled cards. It is simply added to their deck.
4. (Optional) The player may move 1 die in their skill pool to another skill. If the new skill already has a die type, then they swap as long as they are within 1 size from each other.
   1. If a player has a D4 in Trade and a D8 in Intimidation, they are unable to exchange these skills. But if the player has a D4 in Trade and a D6 in Persuasion, they can exchange them making Trade a D6 and Persuasion a D4.
   2. Additionally, you may only move either a D4 or D6 into an unknown skill.
