# Combat Flow

Initiative is drawn every new round by drawing from a normal poker deck of cards. Jokers always go first. If 2 players both draw Jokers, they can decide or roll a dice to see who goes first. If a player and an NPC both draw Jokers, the player always goes first.

After all players and NPCs have gone, the round ends and new cards are drawn. If a Joker has been drawn then the deck is reshuffled before drawing new cards.

## Card "Hands"

"Hands" will not be the final term, but players and more powerful monsters will have a Card "Hand" made up of up to 10 Cards. 

This seems like a good number to allow for a lot of flexibility as far as how a player chooses to build their character. The characters may also carry Decks with as many cards as they have. Decks are not equipped and can not be changed during combat, except during the risky[[Mechanics/Combat#3 - Swapping| Swapping]] combat action.

Cards will probably also act as currency, be upgradable, and evolvable, as to not build up too many. This is still _TBD_.

## Free Actions

1. Characters can move their full movement during their turn, split into any number of incremental movements they want unless otherwise specified by a card.
   1. Characters may NOT attack while moving, unless they have a card that specially allows for it.
2. Characters may draw and equip any weapon or item they are not carrying in a backpack or other type of storage. They may also un-equip in the same way, as long as it does not go into storage.
3. Characters may relay any kind of information to anyone on the playing field.

## Actions

During the main action phase there are 3 types of actions. Attacking, Readying, or Equiping. Characters may only perform 1 type.

### 1 - Attacking

1. Characters may cast any spells or perform any action moves they have in their deck that are not on cooldown, that may affect the enemy or friendly.
   1. If a character has multiple moves they may split them between enemies in any way they wish.
2. If the character has no Card Moves that can cause damage the enemy, they may make an unarmed or armed attack.

> [!note] Always Successful!
> This is a very important difference compared to what most people are used to. Attacks, Spells, Moves, etc. are ALWAYS successful. It's not the character doing it, it's the card and the card can't fail. 
> 
> However, it is up to the defender to avoid these attacks. _See [[Mechanics/Combat#Defense|#Defense]] below_.

### 2- Readying

1. Characters may make case any spells that have no affect on any other character other than themselves.
   1. This includes effects that do not directly touch, harm, help, aid, move, or anything thereof to any other character in combat.
2. Characters may retrieve items from storage if they are close to them.
   1. They may also hand or throw an item to another member of their group.
3. [[Fleeing|Fleeing]], described below, counts in this action.

### 3 - Swapping

1. The player may not perform any action, other than free actions, if they choose to change, modify, or replace their deck
   1. Passive abilities also become inert while this action is being performed, except for attribute modifiers in regards to equipping the new cards, but all passives are regained as soon as the character's turn ends. (Note: not the end of the round, the end of the player's turn)

## Defense

Unlike many games, where it is the attackers' job to score a bit, here their skills give them the ability to do what they intend to do.

However, it is the Defenders job to succeed a saving throw to avoid this attack. The attackers' card will list the available types of saving throws allowed as well as the difficulty rating.

This is performed **after all the attacker's actions have been declared and their turn is over**, unless otherwise specified by the card or a defender's card activates before their turn is completed.

> [!note] Why after the attacker finishes?
> This is meant to be part of the strategy for the attacker. They do not know which of their attacks will fail or succeed and must size up their opponent correctly. Otherwise they will fail and waste their cooldowns. 
> 
> Combat is meant to be a strategic battle of managing card cooldowns, making combos, and coming up with unique uses for cards.

### Saving Throws

Saving throws will _probably_ be based on the character's Attributes.

- Strength - Physical Saving Throw
- Dexterity - Evade Saving Throw
- Intelligence - Notice Saving Throw
- Charisma - Mental Saving throw

How saving throws will be calculated is still _TBD_.

## Disengage

There is no rule for "attack of opportunity" when moving away from an adjacent enemy, unless the enemy, character or NPC, has a card that specifically allows them to take action during this time.

##  Fleeing

The character or NPC must perform the Readying Action until they are at least 100 meters away.
