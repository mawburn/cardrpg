# Skill Overview

As stated in [[Character Creation Advancing | Character Creation & Advancing]], players may assign a single die type to 1 attribute. So these skills are completely separated from [[Mechanics/Attributes|Attributes]]. They represent your character and their personal growth, not how good they are at fighting monsters or evil warlords.

Skills are more or less tags that represent your character and are meant for the RP aspects of the game only. Combat has its own rules and exists outside of the type of RP that would be useful for these skills.

That does not mean they can not have mechanical benefits within the fiction, however. One can avoid a fight using Persuasion or Intimidation for instance. Maybe you come across a shop, the Merchant skill could score you that epic card you're looking for.

- Merchant
- Persuasive
- Charming
- Authoritative
- Intimidating
- Athlete
- Laborer
- Tradesperson (Mechanic, Electrician, etc)
- Academic
- Observant
- Performer
- Artist
- Spiritual
- Nurse

This is not a final list, but the final list should be short and have role-playable redundancies for most skills. 

## Skill Tests

The Game Master should decide how difficult it is for each task as the players encounter them. This takes some quick thinking, but shouldn't be too hard.

If a player has no skill for a task, they simply can not do it. **However**, the exploding die rule is in effect here. This can allow a D4 to succeed at even the hardest task.

The difficulty of a task is based on the die types.

- 4 - an easy task most people with some familiarity should be able to accomplish.
- 6 - not a hard task, but you need some knowledge to complete it.
- 8 - Not that easy, but with some effort and luck you should be able to do it.
- 10 - Usually performed by experts in their field. But sometimes beginners luck triumphs.
- 12 - Whew. You better be pretty damn good to complete this.
- 20 - Since this is an unobtainable level of skill, only sheer force of will, determination, and luck can overcome it.
  - Note: this should be used in extremely rare cases where the impossible may happen and it becomes a story you tell at the table for sessions to come.

### Skill assists

Sometimes players want to work together or help each other out. Let them.

Skill assists come in 2 forms.

1. All the players roll the same type of skill and add the result together.
   1. This doesn't need to be the same exact skill, just as long as it makes sense. If there is a DC 20 boulder blocking the path, then players could their highest skill when it comes to Athletics, Push, or Work.
2. Players can roll an irrelevant skill, but if they can think of a way to tie it into helping the player succeed, then they can roll at the same DC. The player receives +1 to their roll of the support is successful.
   1. If the support roll doubles, triples, or quadruples the DC add +2, +3, or +4 respectively.
   2. The player making the skill check can not receive more than than a total of +4 support, regardless of the results of the other player(s) rolls.
