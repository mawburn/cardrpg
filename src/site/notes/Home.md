# Card Power

Currently just a working title. This is very much a WIP.

If you're reading this, then you are reading my raw notes published through an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden). Some of my notes are not published, but most are.

## Currently only these parts should be considered

* [[Mechanics/Combat|Combat]] - **Most important** becuase it's very differnet than most games.
* [[Mechanics/Attributes|Attributes]] - Base Attributes
* [[Mechanics/Skills|Skills]] - RP Skills & Rules
* [[Mechanics/Character Creation Advancing|Character Creation & Advancement ]]
* [[Mechanics/Cards/Species Cards|Species Cards]] - Details on how cards work

## Playtest Species

* [[Species/Human/Human|Human]]
	* [[Species/Human/Cards|Species/Human/Cards]]

Like cards, there are rules for how to build a speicies under [[Mechanics/Species Rules|Species Rules]].

## Setting Gist

I haven't really nailed down a setting yet, but I have a general idea. Bascially, the setting will be a mutli-world and parallel universe type setting. The idea comes from the book [Jake's Magical Market](https://amzn.to/3d8GJfB), but will be modified heavily and will not use anything directly from the book. 

## Many Different Species

<sup>(aka Races in most games, but not cross breedable here)</sup>

This is very much a core part of the game. If I publish it, I will probably publish a few species and all the rules in a core book and then sell expansions. Similar to how Stars Without Number or Ironsworn work.

Each species will have their own set of cards. Their cards won't be entirely unique as far as what they can do, but the selection should be unique to each species. Every species will come from another world or universe entirely. So things like Elves, Dwarves, Kobolds, etc. will each come from a world or a world in a universe where they are the dominant species on their planet. Each one experiencing an apocalyptic event to thrust them into this new world of combat and danger.

## Species Cards

Cards are not limited to be used by any certain species, but when a species levels up they only recieve free new cards from their species card table.

It should also be easier for players to get cards from a specific species on a world from that species.

## Post Apocalyptic, but not really

_Technically_, the setting will be post apocalyptic, but not in the traditional sense. Something, be it Gods/Aliens/Tear in Space Time/etc will wipe out most of the dominate species on the planet and give a card to each member left from that world a card. This will probably have happened far in the past and species will be able to world hop, encountering an entirely new planet with entirely new dangers.

Monsters in the world will also have card types, but a much more limited set based on the type of monster. Every monster killed will drop at least 1 card. This can be equipped by the player.

Gear will also play an important part in the game. 

I have not decided on a solid setting yet, which means I'm not sure if Modern or SciFi weaponry will be allowed, but I'm leaning on no. Magitech only probably.

### Notes

The Apocalypic event will likely be known as "The Drop" by most species.
