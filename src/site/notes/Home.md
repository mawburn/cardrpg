# Card Power

Currently just a working title. This is very much a WIP.

If you're reading this, then you are reading my raw notes published through an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden). Some of my notes are not published, but most are.

## Currently only these parts should be considered

* [[Mechanics/Attributes|Attributes]]
* [[Mechanics/Skills|Skills]]
* [[Mechanics/Character Creation Advancing|Character Creation Advancing]]
* [[Mechanics/Combat|Combat]]

## Playtest Species

* [[Species/Human/Human|Human]]
	* [[Species/Human/Cards|Cards]]

## Setting Gist

I haven't really nailed down a setting yet, but I have a general idea. Bascially, the setting will be a mutli-world and parallel universe type setting. The idea comes from the book [Jake's Magical Market](https://amzn.to/3d8GJfB), but will be modified heavily and will not use anything directly from the book. 

There will be MANY different species and each one will have their own set of cards. Their cards won't be entirely unique as far as what they can do, but the selection should be unique to each species. Every species will come from another world or universe entirely. So things like Elves, Dwarves, Kobolds, etc. will each come from a world or a world in a universe where they are the dominant species on their planet.

Cards are not limited to be used by any certain species, but when a species levels up they only recieve free new cards from their species card table.

_Technically_, the setting will be post apocalyptic, but not in the traditional sense. Something, be it Gods/Aliens/Tear in Space Time/etc will wipe out most of the dominate species on the planet and give a card to each member left from that world a card. This will probably have happened far in the past and species will be able to world hop, encountering an entirely new planet with entirely new dangers.

Monsters in the world will also have card types, but a much more limited set based on the type of monster. Every monster killed will drop at least 1 card. This can be equipped by the player.

Gear will also play an important part in the game. 

I have not decided on a solid setting yet, which means I'm not sure if Modern or SciFi weaponry will be allowed, but I'm leaning on no. Magitech only probably.

### Notes

The Apocalypic event will likely be known as "The Drop" by most species.
